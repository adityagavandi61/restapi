# REST API in Django

This repository demonstrates the implementation of a basic REST API using Django. REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for building web services that allow interaction between different systems over the internet using HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. This project uses a basic Django setup to create, test, and demonstrate REST API functionalities, enabling seamless communication between the server and client. This is a starting point for understanding and working with RESTful services in Django.
